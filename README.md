Hello and thank you for reviewing my solutions for Second step of acceleration! :)
On the main branch you will find my main solutions for the problems.
Code of each task is in package named by the task itself and you will find test cases in the "Main.java" file.
However, I also found a few different solutions for some of the problems which you can overview on the "Alternative" branch.
Hope you will find these solutions efficient!
